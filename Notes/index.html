    <h1>HTML Basics</h1>
    <p>The HTML begins with typing "html" in atom and clicking enter. It'll come up with the language, the direction, the charset (the encoding) etc..
      The title is what you want the title of the webpage to be displayed in the top tab of the website. This is inside the "head" part of the HTML.
      Besides this the html consists of the <strong>head</strong> and the <strong>body</strong>.
      <br>
      <br>
      Also, to use italics and bold, use the "em" and "strong" tag respectively. Both are closed tags - meaning they have
      an opening <> and a closing <>. Things like the Horizontal rule (hr) and (br) are open tags so only need one set of <>.
    </p>

  <div class="two">
    <p id="Underline1"><strong>This is the anatomy of a html line:</strong></p>
    <img src="Images/html_tags.png" alt="html composition">
  </div>
  <p>Next, there are other things that can be implemented / added such as images, links and tables. To insert a image, type "img" and click enter.
    The source will be the source of the image. Eg: if the img is added to the folder, then look at the hierarchy. Eg: images/image.png
  </p>
  <p>To add a link, use the anchor key - "a". The "href" will be the link and the text you put in between the anchor brackets is the displayed
    text. Eg: <a href="https://colorhunt.co/palette/180404" target="_blank">This is a link to the colour pallettes</a>
  </p>
  <div class="four">
    <span id="span1">Writing a table involves writing "table". Each row, write a "tr" and inside, each "td" is a cell. The first row
      can be the "th", table header. Example:</span>
    <br>

    <!-- Table -->
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Header 1 (th)</th>
        <th>Header 2 (th)</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>td</td>
        <td>td</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>td</td>
        <td>td</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <!-- End of table -->
  </div>
  <div class="five">
    <p class="noStyle">The next thing to learn is <strong>forms.</strong>
      Forms is created by typing forms and pressing enter on atom. It gives an "action" and a "method". <em>Action</em>
      refers to where the form leads you when you press the submit button. <em>Method</em> refers to what you want the
      form to do when you press the submit button.
      <br><br>
      The form needs a "label" to <em>label</em> the title for that entry. The form also needs an "input" to input things
      into the form. There are different input types. Eg: "input type="text" / "email" / "submit" etc... The input type <em>submit</em>
      creates a button. You can even enter "textarea" to create a text field.
      <br><br>
      <strong>Here's an example below:</strong>
    </p>
    <div class="six">
      <div class="seven">
        <form class="" action="" method="post">
          <span>Subscribe to our newsletter!</span>
          <br><br>
          <div class="formTableRow" id="topForm">
            <label for="">Enter your name:</label>
            <input class="Enter" type="text" name="" value="">
          </div>
          <div class="formTableRow">
            <label>Enter your email address:</label>
            <input class="Enter" type="email" name="" value="">
          </div>
          <input id="submit" type="submit" name="" value="Subscribe">
        </form>
      </div>
      <img id="leftArrow" src="Images/leftArrow.png" alt="left Arrow">
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="hr1">
    <hr>

  <div class="button">
    <a id="link" href="css.html" target="_blank"><strong>Click here for CSS notes</strong></a>
  </div>
